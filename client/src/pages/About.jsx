              Also keep an eye out for our recommendations for all coffee
              related equipment and beans. We try everything, from the eyes of
              real customers, and take into account several factors like price,
              usage, necessity etc. before recommending anything. We are also
              not sponsored by any of these brands and post this content just
              for other home baristas.
