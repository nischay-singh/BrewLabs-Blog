# Brew Blog

The final website can be viewed at - https://blog-dashboard-la6s.onrender.com/ 

Welcome to Brew Blog - an interactive, completely responsive blog website for coffee lovers made by coffee lovers. I had the inspiration to make this website while sitting at my favorite coffee shop - Brew Lab! So, I only felt it was fitting to name this blog after them.

On this website, you will find various posts on our one true love - coffee. Users have the ability to comment on the articles and like other users' comments as well. In addition, admins can view a special dashboard of all posts, comments and users and can also create new posts for others to view. This web app was made using the MERN stack and is completely reactive. 

## Instructions to install to your local machine
